# Compilers_Operators : Custom `&` Operator in C++

## Objective

This assignment implements a custom binary `&` operator for a C++ integer wrapper class. The operator behaves as:

```
a & b = (a^2) - (b^2)
```

Where:

* `^` represents exponentiation
* `&` has **left associativity**
* Precedence rules:

  * Highest: `^`
  * Medium: `&`
  * Lowest: `*` and `/`

## How to Compile and Test

1. Compile your code normally with g++:

```bash
 Add Soon ISA

```

2. Compile the encoder tool:

```bash
 Add Soon ISA
```

3. Encode your file for submission:

```bash
 Add Soon ISA
```
